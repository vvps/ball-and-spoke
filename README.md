# ball-and-spoke
A LaTeX library for ball and spokes models

To use the package, download it and place it in the same folder as your .tex file and include the following in your preamble.

    \usepackage{ballandspoke}

To display a ball and spoke model, simply type the following:

    \basWater

or

    \basWater[5]

Where, bas stands for ballandspoke and the number in the square brackets determines the scaling of the figures. By default, the scaling is set to 2 or sometimes 3, depending on the crystal structure.
